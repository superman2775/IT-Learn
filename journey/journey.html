                Broodje56 and Joren, two teenagers from Belgium started this project with a simple idea: to create a platform where people can learn
                and grow together in the field of IT.

                We sill hadn't launched the website because we needed funding. So while searching for ideas to get the funding, we kept on working to make it better.
